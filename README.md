# Module 2 - Challenge

## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 2 Challenge.

In order for my webpage to show what I can do, I used HTML and CSS to:

- Showcase usable links which scroll the UI to the corresponding sections
- I added alt attributes to my images
    - And, I made my first image clickable, which launches my Module 1 - Challenge webpage, my first deployed  project
- I used display flex and media screen, but they are not working for me 100%

You can find my deployed page here:

- <https://tuffythejeep.github.io/Module-2-Challenge/>

and my repository page here:
- <https://github.com/tuffythejeep/Module-2-Challenge>

Here is a picture of my deployed page:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section on this page was laid out based on Semantic HTML styling and tags, as I deleted non-semantic HTML elements. I also ensured my css file contained all appropriate styling elements so my version of the webpage mirrored the UT Challenge source file, when rendered on a browser.

I used Chrome console (inspect) to ensure my edits, adjustments, changes, and tweaks rendered correctly.

## Credits

Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son, who helped me troubleshoot when I was stuck - however, I wrote all my own HTLM and CSS. I was able to ask him questions to clarify, and he promted and challenged me to take breaks and allow my mind to process the solutions which were brewing.

When stuck, I referenced the following sites:

- For FREE Images I used in this REPO: <https://www.pexels.com/search/surf/>
- For learning how to properly link and hyperlink items within my HTML: <https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp>

I referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my webpage, html, and css.

No outside sources of text, html, or css were copied into my work.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue, once I copied all htlm and css files properly.
